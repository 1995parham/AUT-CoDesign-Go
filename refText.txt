order design metrics for networkonchips nocs that have become the defacto standard in providing scalable comunication backbones for multicores computer however noc cant be plagued by higher power consumption and degraded throughput if the network and router are designed properly towards this end this paper proposes a novel router architecture where we tune the frequency of a router in response to network load to manage both performance and power we propose three dynamic frequency tuning techniques freqboost freqthrtl and freqtune targeted at congestion and power management in nocs as enablers for these techniques we exploit dynamic voltage and frequency scaling dvfs and the imbalance in a generic router pipeline through time stealing experiments using synthetic workloads on a x wormholeswitched mesh interconnect show that freqboost is a better choice for reducing average latency maximum while freqthrtl provides the maximum benefits in terms of power saving and energy delay product edp the freqtune scheme is a better candidate for optimizing both performance and power achieving on an average reduction in latency savings in power up to at high load and savings up to at high load in edp with application benchmarks we observe ipc improvement up to using our design the performance and power benefits also scale for larger nocs categories and subject descriptors c

specifically in the nanometer regime it is predicted that noc power can be a significant part of the entire chip power and can account for up to to watts with technology scaling for a mesh based network with nodes a few commercial designs also support this trend where up to of the entire chip power is devoted to the interconnect thus onchip interconnects that can optimize both performance and power pose intriguing research challenges this is evident from the large body of literature covering multiple facets of noc design router frequency is one of the critical design parameter that directly affects both performance and power albeit in a contradictory fashion with a sophisticated design of a router pipeline it is possible to increase the operating frequency but higher router frequency leads to higher power consumption on the other hand a mismatch between processor and routernetwork frequency can result in significant performance penalties thus a prudent control of the router frequency can help in optimizing both performance and power we motivate the fine balance that exists between power and performance in an onchip network with a relative powerperformance tradeoff analysis with respect to offered network load figure shows the relative growth of network power versus network latency for an x mesh with a synthetic traffic mixture of uniform random transpose nearest neighbor and self similar traffic detail network configuration is mentioned later in table a the bars indicate network latencypower normalized with respect to the network latency power at no load idle network at low load the network power consumption is less however the rate of growth of network power is much higher as compared to the rate of growth of network latency for example as shown in figure the network power grows to x as the injection rate varies from to whereas the network latency grows only x we leverage our insights from these trends to optimize the network at low load for performance and at high load for power an activity based powermanagement technique which was recently implemented in the intel core routers shares a similar view of optimizing the network power based on activity albeit in a different fashion by clockgating the idle ports since performance and power are directly proportional to frequency we dynamically modulate the router frequency in response to network load to facilitate these optimizations and demonstrate the advantages at system level specifically at low load we operate the routers at peak frequency at high load we dynamically determine the operating frequency of individual routers in the network the dynamic schemes that determine the operating frequencies of the routers are designed to a reduce power consumption and b manage ratio

network by selectively stepping up and down the frequency of a subset of routers in the congested regions of a network we propose a twoprong approach to vary the baseline router frequency clock scaling and timestealing we employ dynamic voltage and frequency scaling dvfs to scale up and down the router clock frequency below the nominal frequency by switching the operating voltage levels the time stealing technique is employed to boost the baseline router frequency by exploiting the timing imbalance between router pipeline stages such that a router can operate at the average cycle time of all the pipeline stages in contrast to the delay of the worst case pipeline stage we explore three techniques for dynamic frequency tuning to simultaneously address powerperformance tradeoffs the first technique called freqboost initially employs timestealing to operate all routers at a boosted frequency this helps in enhancing the performance at low load conditions while slightly increasing the power consumption however as the network gets congested power consumption becomes a key challenge hence it throttles the frequencyvoltage of selected routers using dvfs the second mechanism called freqthrtl initially operates all routers at the baseline frequency and selectively employs timestealing and dvfs to either increase or decrease the frequency at the onset of congestion this scheme unlike freqboost can modulate frequency of routers bidirectionally higher or lower and consequently can help reduce power and manage congestion at high load more effectively using this technique the frequency of a congested router is boosted at the onset of congestion and the frequency of a router adjacent to this congested router is throttled freqtune is a hybrid of the above two schemes that dynamically switches between freqboost and freqthrtl as the network load varies from low to high we evaluate the performance and power implications of the proposed techniques using a wormholeswitched mesh intrconnect with synthetic and application benchmarks parity compare them with respect to file which baseline router network to further emphasize the efficacy of our approach we compare our results with adaptive routing and with baselin design that employe
